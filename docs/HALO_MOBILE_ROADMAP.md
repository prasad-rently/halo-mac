# Halo Mobile — Feature Development Roadmap & Backlog

> **This document pioneers Halo-mobile development.** It is the single source of
> truth for **which Halo desktop capabilities come to mobile (iOS + Android),
> in what form, and in what order** — plus the mobile-exclusive features that
> only make sense on a phone.
>
> Deep OS-capability analysis lives in
> [`MOBILE_PLATFORM_FEATURES.md`](MOBILE_PLATFORM_FEATURES.md). The **specs** for
> the first mobile features are in [`specs/`](specs/) (F-044/F-045/F-048/F-049/F-050).
> This file is the **actionable backlog + governance**; those are the details.

## 0. Governance — READ BEFORE ADDING ANY FEATURE

Two rules, enforced for every change:

1. **Feasibility study first (mandatory).** Before a feature is added to the
   mobile backlog as "buildable," it must have a **feasibility study** (template
   in §6) covering: the iOS mechanism, the Android mechanism, OS blockers,
   permission cost, store-policy risk, and a verdict. No study → it stays in
   *Unassessed*.
2. **Update this doc when Halo desktop gains a feature.** Every new desktop
   feature (a new `F-xxx`) **must** get a row in the §3 portability table and a
   feasibility study **before** it is considered "done" on desktop. Adding a
   desktop feature without assessing its mobile path is incomplete work.

> Agent/dev note: this rule is mirrored in `CLAUDE.md` so it is not forgotten.
> The desktop `FEATURE_ROADMAP.md` "Definition of Done" includes "mobile
> feasibility row added here."

## 1. Legend

**Portability verdict** (per platform):

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Port | Same capability achievable with a native equivalent |
| 🟡 Adapt | Partial / reduced / different mechanism (scoped, foreground-only, coarse) |
| 🔵 Reimagine | Desktop feature inspires a *different* mobile-native capability |
| ❌ Blocked | OS sandbox/policy prevents it; no viable path |

**Backlog status:** `Unassessed` → `Assessed` (has feasibility study) →
`Planned` (has a spec / F-id) → `In progress` → `Done` → `Won't do`.

---

## 2. Executive summary

Halo desktop's value is **deep macOS system access**. Mobile OSes remove most of
that (sandbox, no process/filesystem/daemon access), so a 1:1 port is neither
possible nor desirable. The mobile strategy is three-pronged:

1. **Port the OS-agnostic wins** — anything that's just computation, networking,
   text, or crypto (speed test, code beautifier, snippets, clipboard transforms,
   HaloShare, AI, report export).
2. **Adapt the storage/insight features** to scoped, permissioned mobile APIs
   (storage insights, duplicate photos, battery, network usage, widgets).
3. **Lead with mobile-exclusive value** the desktop can't have — **SMS sync
   (Android), expenditure tracking, app-usage/digital-wellbeing, notification
   insights, permission auditing** — which is where a phone genuinely helps.

The already-specced first wave (F-044/045/048/049/050) is exactly this: mobile is
the *device-side* of cross-platform features + a HaloShare peer.

## 3. Master portability table (every desktop capability)

Verdicts are **starting positions**; each "Assessed+" row is backed by a
feasibility study (§6). iOS / Android assessed separately.

## 4. Mobile-first backlog (prioritized)

Ordered build queue for Halo Mobile. **P0 = the already-specced first wave.**

### Tier 0 — Specced (build these first; see `specs/`)
- **HaloShare peer (F-050)** — P0, both platforms.
- **SMS sync + console (F-044)** — P0, Android sync / iOS viewer.
- **Clipboard sync (F-045)** — P1.
- **Expenditure (F-048)** — P1.
- **App shell + BYOB Firebase pairing (F-049)** — the container for all of the above.

### Tier 1 — High-value ports (OS-agnostic, quick wins)
1. **Code Beautifier** — pure port; great share-sheet/keyboard fit.
2. **Snippets / text expansion** — mobile keyboard extension makes this *better* than desktop.
3. **Speed test** — fully portable.
4. **Clipboard transform actions** (JSON/base64/hash/QR/case/sort…) — a mobile "Actions-lite".
5. **AI assistant (cloud, F-046)** — huge value on mobile; agentic tool set trimmed to mobile-safe reads.
6. **Health/metrics widget** + **Dashboard-lite** (storage, battery, network).
7. **Report export (PDF)**.
8. **Similar Photos / duplicate photos finder (F-025 port)** — PhotoKit/MediaStore are the *native* photo store on mobile, arguably a better fit than the desktop's loose-file fallback; see §9 study.

### Tier 2 — Adapted insight features (scoped/permissioned)
9. **Storage insights** (scoped SpaceLens in granted scope).
10. **Drive/storage speed test (F-043 port)**.
11. **VPN / network status**.
12. **On-device AI (F-047 mobile runtime)**.
13. **Smart scan / scheduled digest** (BG-task constrained).

### Tier 3 — Best-effort / low priority
14. Applications list (Android), Launch-at-boot (Android), Cleanup guidance.

## 5. Mobile-exclusive expansion (features the desktop can't have)

A phone unlocks capabilities Halo desktop never could — these should be
**first-class**, not afterthoughts (each needs a feasibility study before build):

| Idea | iOS | Android | Notes |
|------|:---:|:-------:|-------|
| **App usage / digital wellbeing** | 🟡 | ✅ | ScreenTime `DeviceActivity` (iOS, restricted) / `UsageStatsManager` (Android) |
| **Notification insights / history** | ❌ | ✅ | Android `NotificationListenerService`; iOS none |
| **Per-app network data usage** | ❌ | ✅ | Android `NetworkStatsManager`; iOS aggregate only |
| **Permission auditor** (what apps can access) | 🟡 | ✅ | Android PackageManager; iOS limited |
| **Duplicate/junk photos cleaner** | ✅ | ✅ | Photos frameworks — big mobile pain point |
| **Device security posture** (lock, encryption, OS patch) | ✅ | ✅ | Read-only checks + advice |
| **Call log / spam insight** | ❌ | 🟡 | Android CallLog (policy-heavy); iOS none |
| **Battery/charging habits** | 🟡 | ✅ | Charging history + advice |

> These are the reason a Halo *phone* app is compelling beyond "companion to
> desktop." SMS + expenditure (already specced) are the flagship examples.

## 7. Change process (how this doc stays current)

1. A **new desktop feature** (`F-xxx`) is proposed → its DoD includes a **mobile
   feasibility study** (§6) and a **row in §3** here. (Governance rule #2.)
2. If mobile-viable → add to the §4 backlog at the right tier with a status.
3. When it gets a mobile spec, set status `Planned` and link the `specs/` file.
4. Keep the §8 change log updated.

> Reciprocal hook: `docs/FEATURE_ROADMAP.md` and `CLAUDE.md` reference this rule
> so desktop work triggers the mobile assessment automatically.

## 9. Feasibility studies — Tier 1 candidates

Completed studies (per §6). These move the rows to **Assessed ✓** and are ready to
promote to `Planned` (spec) when scheduled.

### Feasibility — Code Beautifier (from desktop F-038)
- **Desktop capability:** regex syntax highlighter (14 langs) + 8 themes, live preview, PNG export @2x/4x (`NSHostingView` render), copy to clipboard, auto-detect language from clipboard.
- **iOS mechanism:** the highlighter is pure Swift → **reuses desktop code directly**; SwiftUI render; **`ImageRenderer`** (iOS 16+) for PNG; `UIPasteboard`. Verdict ✅
- **Android mechanism:** Kotlin port of the regex highlighter; Compose `AnnotatedString`; capture Composable → `Bitmap` for PNG; `ClipboardManager`. Verdict ✅
- **OS blockers:** none. **Permissions:** none. **Store-policy risk:** none.
- **Scope on mobile:** full; great **share-sheet** target ("beautify this snippet") + keyboard-adjacent use.
- **Effort:** iOS ~1.5 d (reuse) · Android ~3 d (port). **Dependencies:** F-049 shell.
- **Verdict:** **Port** → **P1**. **Recommendation:** build early — highest value-to-effort ratio; iOS is nearly free.

### Feasibility — Snippets / Text Expansion (from desktop F-027)
- **Desktop capability:** snippet store + `SnippetExpander` (5 placeholders `{date}{time}{clipboard}{uuid}{random:N}`), editor, categories, import/export.
- **iOS mechanism:** store + expansion engine port (Swift, shared). System-wide expansion needs a **Keyboard Extension** (Halo keyboard); `{clipboard}` + any network need **"Allow Full Access"**. Verdict ✅ manager / 🔵 keyboard.
- **Android mechanism:** store + engine port (Kotlin). System-wide expansion via a custom **IME** (Halo keyboard) or accessibility text insertion. Verdict ✅ manager / 🔵 IME.
- **OS blockers:** true auto-expansion only inside the Halo keyboard/IME the user enables (not system-global from a normal app).
- **Permissions:** iOS "Allow Full Access" (privacy prompt) for clipboard/sync; Android IME enablement.
- **Store-policy risk:** keyboard extensions/IMEs are allowed; iOS Full-Access keyboards get extra review.
- **Scope on mobile:** manager+expander full; expansion where the Halo keyboard is used. Mobile keyboards make this arguably **better than desktop**.
- **Effort:** iOS ~4 d (engine reuse + keyboard ext) · Android ~5 d (IME). **Dependencies:** F-049 shell; pairs with F-045 (clipboard placeholder).
- **Verdict:** **Port + Reimagine** → **P1**. **Recommendation:** ship the manager first; keyboard/IME as a fast-follow.

### Feasibility — Speed Test (from desktop Performance)
- **Desktop capability:** 25 MB download / 5 MB upload / 10-ping median RTT, socket-based (`URLSession`).
- **iOS mechanism:** `URLSession` — **identical code**. Verdict ✅
- **Android mechanism:** OkHttp / `HttpURLConnection` — direct port. Verdict ✅
- **OS blockers:** none. **Permissions:** Android `INTERNET` (normal). **Store-policy risk:** none.
- **Scope on mobile:** full (mobile arguably a *more* natural home for a speed test).
- **Effort:** iOS ~0.5 d · Android ~1 d. **Dependencies:** F-049 shell.
- **Verdict:** **Port** → **P1**. **Recommendation:** trivial win; bundle into the mobile Dashboard.

### Feasibility — Similar Photos / Duplicate Photos Finder (from desktop F-025)
- **Desktop capability:** DCT-based 64-bit perceptual hash (pHash) over loose image files (`~/Pictures`, `~/Downloads`, `~/Desktop`) plus an optional Photos Library scan via PhotoKit; Hamming-distance clustering (default ≤8/64 bits) with union-find, "recommended keep" auto-selection (highest resolution → most recent), `trashItem`/`PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets` deletion behind a confirmation dialog.
- **iOS mechanism:** `PHPhotoLibrary` / `PHAsset` / `PHImageManager` — **this is actually the primary photo store on iOS**, more natural than the desktop's loose-file fallback. The DCT/pHash math (`ImageIO` thumbnail → grayscale grid → DCT-II → 64-bit fingerprint) is pure Swift/Foundation and ports directly; `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` behaves the same on iOS. Verdict ✅
- **Android mechanism:** `MediaStore.Images` (`ContentResolver` query) is the Android equivalent of the PhotoKit fetch; the DCT/pHash algorithm is trivially portable to Kotlin (or shared via KMP) since it's just grayscale-bitmap math over a small thumbnail (`BitmapFactory` + `Bitmap.createScaledBitmap`). Verdict ✅
- **OS blockers:** none — both platforms expose a full read/write photo-library API designed for exactly this use case (unlike the desktop, where PhotoKit is a bolt-on and loose files are the common case).
- **Permissions required:** iOS `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (read/write, since deletion needs write) with a limited-access affordance; Android `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` (13+) / `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (legacy) plus `MediaStore` delete-request confirmation (Android 11+ requires `MediaStore.createDeleteRequest` user confirmation, which conveniently satisfies the mandatory-confirmation rule for free).
- **Store-policy risk:** none — both stores have long-standing, well-understood photo-library permission flows; no sensitive-permission review flags expected.
- **Scope on mobile:** full — arguably a **stronger fit than desktop**, since phones are where "50 near-identical burst shots" and "screenshot re-shares" actually accumulate. This is one of the flagship ideas already called out in §5 ("Duplicate/junk photos cleaner").
- **Effort:** iOS ~2.5 d (hash engine port + PhotoKit fetch + clustering UI) · Android ~3.5 d (Kotlin port of DCT + MediaStore fetch + confirmation flow). **Dependencies:** F-049 shell.
- **Verdict:** **Port** → **P1**. **Recommendation:** high mobile value, low platform risk — promote to the mobile backlog (Tier 1/2) ahead of most desktop-only insight features; the desktop PhotoKit half of F-025 (entitlement-wired, runtime-untested) is the natural starting point for the iOS engine port once it gets its first real permission-grant test pass.

### Feasibility — AI Assistant, cloud (from desktop F-046)
- **Desktop capability:** agentic assistant over Claude/OpenAI/Gemini (streaming + tool-use), tools from F-042 intents + `ActionLibrary`, read-auto / act-confirm, persisted chat.
- **iOS mechanism:** provider layer + agent loop port (Swift, largely shared with desktop core); `URLSession` streaming; **Keychain** keys. Tools = the *mobile* capability set (battery/storage/network/clipboard reads; export/HaloShare acts) exposed as **iOS App Intents**. Verdict ✅ chat / 🟡 agentic (fewer tools).
- **Android mechanism:** provider layer port (Kotlin, OkHttp streaming); **Keystore** keys; agent loop; tools = Android capabilities. Verdict ✅ chat / 🟡 agentic.
- **OS blockers:** none for chat; agentic scope bounded by what mobile Halo can *do* (much smaller tool set than desktop's 108 actions).
- **Permissions:** none (BYO key); network. **Store-policy risk:** none (BYO key, no shared inference).
- **Scope on mobile:** full chat + context (clipboard/selection/share-sheet input); **trimmed** agent toolset.
- **Effort:** iOS ~5 d · Android ~6 d (three providers + streaming + Keystore). **Dependencies:** F-049 shell; mirrors F-046 desktop architecture.
- **Verdict:** **Port (chat) + Adapt (agentic)** → **P1**. **Recommendation:** high value on mobile; ship chat + context first, add the small mobile tool set incrementally. Consider sharing the Swift provider layer between macOS + iOS.
